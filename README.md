### users
You can always login with public account : 'public'.

Private usernames could have changed during the test and demo, and you do not have access to 'users.txt' in this directory, so sorry there's no fixed private user for you to login. Try 'zhuofuli' or 'jinhaocui' or 'test'. If not lucky that none of the above exists, feel free to create a new private account.
